# EX 5D Flower Planting.
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a Java program to for given constraints.
You are given n gardens, labelled from 1 to n.

You also have a list called paths, where each element paths[i] = [xi, yi] represents a bidirectional road connectingthe  garden xi and garden yi.

You want to plant one flower in each garden, and there are exactly 4 types of flowers labelled as 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Your goal is to plant flowers such that:

No two connected gardens (i.e., connected via a path) have the same flower type.

Return any valid flower assignment as an array where:

answer[i] is the flower type planted in the (i+1) ᵗʰ garden

It is guaranteed that:

No garden is connected to more than 3 other gardens

A valid flower assignment always exists

## Algorithm

1. Input the Data
Read the number of gardens n and the number of paths m.
Read each of the m paths that connect two gardens and store them in an adjacency list (undirected graph). 
2. Build the Adjacency List
For each path (x, y), add y to the adjacency list of x and vice versa (convert to 0-based indexing).
3. Initialize Flower Assignment
Create an array ans[] of size n to store the flower type (1–4) for each garden.
Each garden will eventually have one flower type assigned.
4.  Assign Flowers Greedily
For each garden:
Create a boolean array used[5] to track which flower types are already used by its adjacent gardens.
For every neighbor, mark its flower type as used.
5. Output the Result
Print the flower type assigned to each garden in order.
